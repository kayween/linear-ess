# Elliptical Slice Sampling for Linearly Truncated Normal Sampling

This repository implements an improved elliptical slice sampling for truncated multivariate normal distributions described in the paper.


## How to Run the Code?
The file `./src/ess.py` implements the algorithm.
To run the code, you will need to export the python path as follows.
```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/this/repository
```

See examples in `./plot/`.
